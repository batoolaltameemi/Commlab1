            The inspiration behind the video was to create a captivating and heartfelt portrayal of university life at NYU Abu Dhabi. The goal was to capture the essence of this unique academic experience, highlighting the challenges, personal growth, and diverse community that make it special. The video aimed to resonate with both students and the wider audience by conveying the vibrancy and complexity of university life.

            The story behind the poem within the video is deeply personal and reflective. It serves as a poetic narrative of the narrator's own journey through university life. Each stanza represents a significant moment or emotion experienced during this transformative period. The poem is a creative expression of the narrator's exploration, self-discovery, and growth as they navigate the challenges and opportunities that come with higher education.
            
            By weaving this original poem into the video, the creators aimed to add depth and emotion to the visual storytelling. The poem becomes the emotional heartbeat of the video, allowing viewers to connect on a deeper level with the narrator's personal experiences and reflections on their university journey. It serves as a powerful and relatable element that enhances the overall narrative of the video.

                            work, and I've always wanted to train myself to paint some
                            of his work in my own fashion. This was my attempt to study
                            the post-impressionism movement in depth by painting two
                            of his works blended together.

                    <pre>
In Sharjah's embrace, the desert sands unfold,
Where ancient tales and cultures, richly told.
A jewel in the Gulf, by azure waters kissed,
Where modernity and heritage coexist.
                        
Sharjah's skyline, a testament to dreams,
With spires that reach for celestial streams.
In its souks and streets, traditions thrive,
A tapestry of life, where old and new collide.
                        
From Al Qasba's lights to Corniche's serene shore,
Where history whispers, and futures soar
A land of art and culture, vibrant and grand,
In Sharjah's heart, we all find our strand.
                        
The call to prayer, the mosques' tranquil chime,
Resonates through time, an eternal rhyme.

                <p>
                    <pre>
In strokes of starry nights and sunflowers bold,
Van Gogh's canvas, a tale of passion untold.
A tortured soul, through colors he'd convey,
The beauty and torment of each fleeting day.
                        
With swirling skies and midnight's mystic dance,
He painted dreams, a wild, transcendent trance.
The artist's heart, a tempestuous sea,
Reflected in art, his deepest plea.
                        
From Arles' fields to the Café Terrace's gleam,
Each stroke a whisper of the artist's dream.
In colors vivid and with brushstrokes free,
He bared his soul for all to see.
                        
Through anguish and madness, he'd strive and strive,
To capture the essence of life's endless drive.

A thought, a spark within my mind's vast sea,
A fleeting wisp of possibility set free.
It dances through the corridors of thought,
A silent whisper, a vision sought.
                    
A dream unfurling in the quiet night,
Illuminating the darkness with its light.
A seed of hope or a question to explore,
In the labyrinth of my mind, it will implore.
                    
With each heartbeat, it finds its place,
In the tapestry of thoughts, it leaves a trace.
A puzzle piece, a puzzle's start,
A thought, a universe within my heart.

Invisible, yet it holds such power,
A thought can bloom, a thought can tower.
